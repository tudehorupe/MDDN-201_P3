						<p>What causes it?</p>
					</div>
					<div class = "main-our-impact-body-text-1">
						<p>Mainly coming from energy use and production, such as burning fossil fuels, a release of gases and chemicals enter the air damaging the quality of it for various species. In the form of carbon dioxide and methane, this then leads to higher disease risks and rising temperatures. Not only is air pollution a destructive force, it has also increased the rate at which the earth’s temperature is changing.</p>

						<p>Why it matters?</p>
					</div>
					<div class = "main-our-impact-body-text-1">
						<p>This then leads to higher disease risks and rising temperatures, as in 2016, <a class="our-impact-external-link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/pollution/" target="_blank">this resulted in 4.2 million premature deaths.</a> Not only is air pollution a destructive force, it has also increased the rate at which the earth’s temperature is changing, therefore, causing it to be a considerable global hazard.</p>

						<p><a class="our-impact-external-link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation/" target="_blank">Farming, grazing of livestock, mining, and drilling together equate to more than half of all deforestation.</a> This is due to an increased demand for different supplies in which extra land is required in order to produce this content.</p>

						<p>Why it matters?</p>
					</div>
					<div class = "main-our-impact-body-text-1">
						<p>Not only does deforestation affect local people and animals immediately involved with the location, it also has significant impacts for the wider world. Given the process of trees absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and producing oxygen, the retention of large forest masses is crucial for a healthy plant, and therefore a healthy lifestyle for wildlife and humans.</p>
