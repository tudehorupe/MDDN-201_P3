						<p>Takeaway food offers convenience for many; however, it produces an extensive amount of waste leading to negative environmental impacts. With majority of this fast food coming in in the form of <a class="my-impact-external-link" href="https://phys.org/news/2018-12-takeaway-containersthe-environmental-favorite-fast-foods.html" target="_blank">aluminium, polystyrene (Styrofoam) and polypropylene (clear plastic),</a> there are various usages for these items all with a single-use intention. Not only is the disposal of these items an issue, but the manufacturing process produces significant impacts.</p>

						<p>The daily ritual of coffee is another contributor which presents negative impacts on our eco. With <a class="my-impact-external-link" href="https://www.mindfood.com/article/disposable-coffee-cups/" target="_blank">500 billion</a> single-use coffee cups used and disposed worldwide every year, the rate of this consumption is troubling for the health of our natural environment. For each of these disposable cups, approximately 200 litres of water are used for manufacturing. Once broken down, the various micro plastics imbedded in the cup then become ingestible for animals, impacting the entire food chain.</p>

						<p>Another aspect which relates to personal impacts on our eco, is the transport sector. The process of getting from one place to another with ease has become at the forefront of consumer minds. However, well before a vehicle is able to go on the road, the manufacturing process generates considerable amounts of energy. Once road ready, about <a class="my-impact-external-link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/green-guide/buying-guides/car/environmental-impact/" target="_blank">80 to 90% of environmental impacts</a> are due to fuel consumptions and emissions of air pollution and greenhouse gases which is then linking to global warming impacts.</p>
