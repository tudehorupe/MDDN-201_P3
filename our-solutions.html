						<p>With alternative sources for energy production such as <a class="our-solutions-external-link" href="https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-energy/renewable-energy/environmental-impacts" target="_blank">solar, hydro, and wind power,</a> these processes allow for change from the burning of fossil fuels. Through taking advantage of these options for various activities, less harm can then be generated worldwide.</p>

						<p>The transport sector of New Zealand contributes <a class="our-solutions-external-link" href="https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/we-all-have-role-play/what-you-can-do-about-climate-change" target="_blank">19% of New Zealandâ€™s total greenhouse gas emissions.</a> Given the considerable share this sector possesses regarding these emissions, appropriate action to mitigate these impacts is necessary. A significant manner for reducing this can be through alternative mediums of travel. Through walking or cycling, this presents the most viable option for long term sustained improvements. Not only is it better for our eco as well as our health, but it also presents a more cost-effective option, making the use of these forms of transport appropriate alternatives to using harmful vehicles.</p>
						<p>If a vehicle is required however, there are approaches which can offer minimal impacts. Through the process of carpooling, using public transport, and planning trips in advance to reduce the amount of travel, these options can offer assistance for long-term improvements.</p>

						<p>What we eat and how we consume food products is also a key contributor to environmental impacts. With red meat production emitting larger quantities of greenhouse gas compared to poultry and meat free alternatives, this in turn impacts air pollutions and deforestation as demand for land for this production has led to alternative impacts.</p>
						<p>The form of which many food items are packaged in also has diabolical impacts on the sustainability of the environment as it is estimated there are <a class="our-solutions-external-link" href="https://phys.org/news/2018-12-takeaway-containersthe-environmental-favorite-fast-foods.html" target="_blank">2025 million takeaway containers per year being used in the European Union (EU) alone.</a> With the various forms this packing can come in, a consideration of getting takeaway foods and the environmental impact this has, is important before purchase. Better still, bringing personal reusable alternatives will assist greatly in this reduction as the longevity these sources offer will assist significantly.</p>
